# TESTING

TDD & BDD

## Mocha

PACKAGE.JSON
  - `"test": "mocha **/*.test.js"`
    - replace `**` with the name of the folder in which the test exist.

TEST FILE - NOT USING ASSERTION LIBRARY
- `const <name> = require (<name of file being tested)`
  - this will be used in the test file to call whatever function is being tested.
- `it('<should description of what function should do>', <callback>)`
  - let's us define a new test case.
  - takes two arguments:
    1) String description what test is doing.
    2) Callback function where the actually testing occurs.
    - EXAMPLE:
    ```
    it('should square a number', () => {
      var result = utils.square(2);

      if ( result != 4) {
          throw new Error('Expected 9, but got ${result}.');
      }
    });
    ```

TEST WATCHING
- `$ nodemon --exec 'npm test'`
  - this can be put into `package.json` file.

# APIs

## GRAPHQL Vs REST
### REST
- 1) Stateless servers (every request in a brand new request even if  it's a request that will seem to create a continat) and structure access to resources.
- 2) It's a strict specification for what the technologiy can bo bet spread widely.
- 3) Ever changing front-end doesn't go well with the static nature of the traditional AP system.
EXAMPLE - Blog App
3 endpoints
- /user/<id>
- /users/<id>/posts
- /users/<id>/followers
There will be 3 different req/res cycles to get data for the user id, posts, and followers. This brings back redundant data (all the data in the user object, posts object, and followers object) and, if the api is customised takes time to recustomise it.

### GRAPHQL
Design principles:
- Hierarchical - Many web connected products involve creating and manipulating hierarchies. GraphQl is structured similarly to the data it returns.
- Product-centric - Driven by the requirements of front-end engineers.
- Strong-typing - Every graphQL server defines an application-specific type system with queries executed in the context of that system. This allows validation before execution of query.
- Client-specified queries - The type system informs the client what it can consume from the server and makes the client responsible for choosing how to consume the data. This is unlike other apis in which the server determines what can be returned in the form of it's various static endpoints.
- Introspective - A graphQl server's type system can be queried by the language itself.

It consists of:
- Type system
- Query language and execution semantics
- Static validation
- Type introspection

There is only 1 API endpoint. A req has a query will all the data required for that screen such as
REQ
  ```
  query {
    User( id: ) {
      name
      posts {
        title
      }
      followers( last: ) {
        name
      }
    }
  }
  ```
RES - this is a JSON object so the keys are double quoted.
```
{
"data" {
  User {
    name: "Mary"
    posts: [
      { title: "whatever title" },
      { title: "whatever title" },
      { title: "whatever title" },
    ],
    followers: [
      { name: "Name of follower"  },
      { name: "Name of follower"  },
      { name: "Name of follower"  },
    ]
  }
}
}
```
This can simply be extracted into the page.
#### BENEFITS
- No more OVERFETCHING: gives data that isn't used by the client end
- No more UNDERFETCHING: doesn't give enough data, _the n+1 problem_
- Insightful analytics -
  - Granular details about what data is used by client
  - Enables evolution of API
  - Opportunities for performance monitoring - resolver functions are used by graphQL that can be used to monitor performance.
- Schema and Types
  - strong typing
  - schema is contract between client and server
  - front and back can work as independent teams

#### CORE CONCEPTS
Schema Definition Language (SDL) - this is the syntax of graphQL used to define the API end point which is a GraphQL Schema, otherwise known as Interface Definition Language or Schema Definition Language. Schema's most important aspects are the _fields_ and _types_. A schema is a collection of types but there are root types (query, mutation, subscription) that define the entry point for the API.

- Type System - the heart of any graphQl implementation is the type system: a description of what types of objects can be returned.
  - In the type system shorthand for non-null is "!".
    - It is possible to return null because any graphQl implementation can interact with many different services that may not be available.
    - This also allows us to return errors messages if there is a null returned.
  - Interface type - This is a list of fields, a type that acts as a connection between two separate types in GraphQl. In the Star Wars example the interface type between Human and Droid was 'Character', this contained fields common to both.

# DATABASE - MONGODB

Help with getting it running: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37096517/mongodb-error-how-can-i-solve-the-erro-in-mongodb

- The problem was an error in the spelling of a command. The error is in the documentation. I'm not sure why. When I search for `ls /lib/systemd/system | grep mongod` I find `mongodb.service` instead of what the documentation says I should find `mongod.service`. I just changed whatever command I needed to add the d and that changed everything.
- Commands:
  - START: sudo service mongodb start
  - STOP: sudo service mongodb stop
  - STATUS: sudo service mongodb status

# EXPORTS & MODULE.EXPORTS

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7137397/module-exports-vs-exports-in-node-js
- http://www.hacksparrow.com/node-js-exports-vs-module-exports.html
   - module.exports has a higher priority over exports.

# NODE ES6
- Basically node.js [doesn't natively support ES6 syntax](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30878363/import-es6-for-node), we have to install another package to use this.

# GLOSSARY

- Î» - this is the 11th letter of the Greek alphabet. It is called lambda.

- [MOVE](http://cirw.in/blog/time-to-move-on.html) - a type of architecture for software similar to Model View Controller but instead has Models Operations Views and Events.

- [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) - an website or web application that dynamically reloads content on one page instead of loading new pages for different content. All the required code is load on first load and no page reload happens.
